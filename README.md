Destination_Toolkit
===================

A tookit for video game development

Destination is an free to use Game Programming Toolkit. The libraries that I make are free to use for any purpose.

FreeImage_Library?: There are 8 projects for this library. These were needed for the OpenGL MY_UI Renderer texture loader. You can check it out at http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

Allocator_example: Custom memory allocator, which can improve allocation speed by 1000% vs the standard OS calls.

Assimp_Lib?: A dump of the latest release of ASSIMP, which is by far the best Model Importing Library out there. For their License and information goto, http://assimp.sourceforge.net/

Common_Game_Objects_Lib?: Any code that is shared between the Client and Game server goes into this library project.

crypto++Lib: An amazing free to use c++ encryption library. For their License and information goto, http://www.cryptopp.com/

Fire_Demo?: A modified version of a fire demo from http://www.rastertek.com/tutindex.html

Fireworks Particle Demo: A project to get myself into creating particle systems. This is taken from the Directx SDK.

Glew_Lib?: I was having problems with the Glew Library running correctly with different Builds. The correct DLL's were not being selected and so I decided it was easier to include the library. This library is needed for the OpenGL My_UI Renderer.

Graphics_Example?: A bear-bones example on how to use the graphics library.(Just added 6/14 with mesh loading to come)

Graphics_Lib?: A directx library that abstracts much of the directx details to the library.

Model Loading Example: Static mesh load and draw properly. Now, I will add UI functionality for modifying the Static mesh and save it to a custom format. After that, i will do an animated loader.

MY_UI_DX_Example: A working example of the Direct X version of MY_UI.

MY_UI_DX_Renderer_Lib?: The Direct X MY_UI Renderer.

MY_UI_GL_Example: A working example of the OpenGL version of MY_UI.

MY_UI_GL_Renderer_Lib?: The Open GL MY_UI Renderer.

MY_UI_Lib: Just the Lib for MY_UI so I dont have a mess of code in different projects.

Network_Chat_Client_Example?, Network_Chat_Server_Example?: Run the Server first, then the Client afterwards. Then run 2 or three more Clients to see the basics of my network library and how it works.

Network_Standard_Client_Example?, Network_Standard_Server_Example?: Run the Server first, then a single client afterwards. This is a barebones example on how to setup a client and send. Also to note the example shows how packets are fragmented and reassembled on the other side.

Ocean_Demo?: A Direct X implementation of the ocean renderer based on the work found here http://www-evasion.imag.fr/Membres/Eric.Bruneton/

Patcher: This is my first attempt at creating a patcher program to keep my Client Up-to- date. It works by connecting to an ftp address and basically just syncs itself to the contents of the ftp server.

Physics_Lib?: The beginning of my physics library containing bounding volumes as well as other code that I haven’t completed yet.

Sky Dome: A working sky and sun demo. The dome is always positioned over the camera and scaled to be as big as the far plane.

Sound_Lib?: Directx based sound engine. Simplifies loading and playing of music, sound effects, as well as handles 3d sounds. Still alot of functionality to implement here . . . stay tuned

Threading_Example?: An example of my TASK based, threading library and how to use it. (this is outdated as of c++11 with async and future. If you want to see how it was done in the good ol days, check it out.)

Utilities_Lib?: This contains my network code, math code, threading code , as well as some other utilities… Hence the name: Utilities!
